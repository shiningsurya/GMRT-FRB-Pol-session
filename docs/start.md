# Welcome

Welcome to the tutorial session of the GMRT Polarimetry. In this session, we will polarization calibrate and measure various polarization observables of bursts of repeating Fast Radio Burst 20180916B detected using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in Band 4 (550 to 750 MHz).

We have five bursts, three detected on MJD 59243 and two on MJD 59894. MJD 59243 bursts are calibrated using a polarized quasar (3C138) and MJD 59894 bursts using a noise diode scan. In either case, the calibration procedure is the same.

Post calibration, we will measure the Rotation Measure (RM), Positon Angle (PA), and linear polarization fraction (Lp).

## Before we get started

Scripts and commands are shown in `this fashion`. Full commands are shown as
```
<full-command>.
```

Commands which are part of `psrchive` are shown as
```
psrchive>
``` but are expected to be run from script.

Regular scripts are shown as 
```
$> script.py ...
```
